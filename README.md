Why Kinepop?

I wanted to solve a problem. Everytime I had to choose a movie to see, I would spend ages. 

KinePOP allows me to scan movie posters quickly, examine actors/directors filmographies at light speed, and get a general feeling about the rating.  

But this isn't the only reason I built KinePOP. 

I wanted to **test my skills** and **apply what I learned** during the last 18 months. Was Redux essential for this project? No!

 I'm happy to introduce my project: this is Kinepop.
